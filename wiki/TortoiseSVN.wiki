#summary Brief user's guide for TortoiseSVN

_See the [Development_Guide#Install_TortoiseSVN Development Guide] for the installation & setup of TortoiseSVN._

= SVN Commits =
If you have made changes to the ReactOS source and you want to send those changes upstream to the ReactOS SVN repository, then you want to make a _commit_.  Note that commits made here only affect this database; you are not directly submitting commits to the official ReactOS trunk located at http://www.ReactOS.org/.

To submit a commit, it is best to not have Visual Studio running.  Navigate Windows Explorer to your ReactOS source folder.  It will look something like this:<br>

Note the red icon on the folder.  This indicates that you have made changes to your source since you last committed/synced.  Right-click on the folder and select SVN Commit.  (Note in this screen shot that a different option is highlighted.)<br>

*SECTION INCOMPLETE?*

When finished, your ReactOS source folder will have a green icon over it, like this:<br>

= SVN Update =
This is the opposite making a commit.  If your source is outdated, or if you want to discard all changes you have made to your copy of the source, then you want to perform an SVN Update.  *Do not redownload the entire source.*  That is a waste of time and bandwidth. Navigate to your ReactOS source and right-click it.  Select "SVN Update" as in this screenshot:<br>
https://reactos.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/SVN%20Sync%202%20-%20en.png

Your copy of the source will begin to sync with the online version.  This window will notify you of the progress:<br>

When finished, your ReactOS source will again have the green "no changes have been made" icon over it.

= Resolving Conflicts =
Sometimes you will try to update or commit a file that has been changed online and changed by you.  This results in a conflict, which looks like this:<br>
https://reactos.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/SVN%20Sync%204%20-%20en.png

To resolve the conflict, you must decide to use the online copy ("theirs") , or your own copy ("mine").  You can also compare the two, and even open your copy to make changes as needed.  These are your available options:<br>

In this example, I chose to discard my copy and use "theirs".

When finished dealing with conflicts, you will again have the green icon over your ReactOS source folder.
