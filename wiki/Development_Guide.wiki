#summary Developer Guide For ReactOS Contributors Using Visual Studio.
<wiki:toc max_depth="5" />

= Overview =
Starting from scratch (having only Windows installed), building ReactOS on Visual Studio requires some Development Tools, the ReactOS source, and some configuration.  That's what this guide is for.  This guide will also assume a certain level of technical ability on your part, as this is a guide to compiling an operating system.

Also, please note that building ReactOS with Visual Studio is still a work in process.  ReactOS built with Visual Studio cannot yet successfully boot.

= Install Development Tools =
The tools you'll need are MS Visual Studio, an SVN Client, a Virtual Machine (not mandatory _per se_, but HIGHLY recommended), and a couple other utilities.

== Install Visual Studio ==
We support MS Visual Studio 2010 and 2012.  Other versions have not been tested and are not expected to work.  MS Visual Studio 2010 and 2012 can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads.  Note that all Express versions are free, and all 2010/2012 versions require the Microsoft .NET 4.5 framework.  All versions of Visual Studio Express require a free registration within 30 days of installation.

=== Install Visual Studio 2010 ===
Download link: http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads

We do not recommend getting Visual Studio 2010, but you can use it if you already have it.

=== Install Visual Studio 2012 ===
Download link: http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads

For VS 2012, the recommended version is Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Desktop.  Windows 8 users may want (need?) to install Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows 8 instead.  There is a flaw in VS2012 related to .NET 4.5, and the fix can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36020.  On first run, let VS2012 update itself with Update 3.  It's a shame that isn't included in the initial download as it's about 2GB when installed.  Get comfortable or go do something else while this is happening.  You may want to run Windows Update after installation to ensure all related components are up to date.

== Install SVN Client ==
An SVN (Apache Subversion) client will allow you to access the source of ReactOS.  If you have commit access, then you can commit your changes back to the ReactOS SVN database.  We recommend TortoiseSVN, and this guide will assume that's the client you've chosen.  You can use another SVN client, but you'll need to configure it yourself.

=== Install TortoiseSVN ===
Download link: http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html

Make sure to download the right architecture (x86 or x64) for your system.  Windows XP users may need to update MSI installer (TortoiseSVN has a link).  Also note that TortoiseSVN comes with only language.  Additional language packs are available for download as well.

When installing TortoiseSVN, make sure to install everything including the command line utilities.

== Install a Virtual Machine ==
A Virtual Machine will let you test the compiled operating system without risking data loss on your actual PC.  There are several great options to choose from.

=== Install Virtual Machine Manager ===
Download link: http://virt-manager.org/

Linux only at this time.

=== Install VirtualBox ===
Download link: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

For Windows, Linux, OS X, and Solaris.  A full-featured and easy-to-use virtual machine.

=== Install VMWare ===

=== Install QEMU ===

== Install WinRAR ==
WinRAR?  What's this for?  Why not the FOSS alternative, 7-Zip?

== Install Dependency Walker ==

== Install WinFlashTool ==

= Consult JIRA =

= Pull Source Code From Repository =
As long as your SVN client supports command line access, you're fine.  Open up command prompt and navigate to where you'd like to put the source code.

If you're a member and you'd like commit access, use the following command (replace <<name@email.com>> with your Google Code email account).  Note that it's *https*, not http.

{{{svn checkout https://reactos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ reactos --username <<name@email.com>>}}}

If you're not a member, or you'd like to download anonymously, you can get a read-only copy with the following command.  This time it's http.

{{{svn checkout http://reactos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ reactos-read-only}}}

The most recent checkout clocked in at 661MB, so this may take a while depending on your internet connection.

= Load ReactOS.sln =
Open up Visual Studio, and load a new project.  Navigate to the folder you put the source code in.  Navigate further to reactos\reactos\reactos.sln and open it.  This is an operating system, remember, so expect this to take a couple minutes.  Once it's done, you're ready to make some changes!

If you want to perform a test of compiling ReactOS, there's a couple changes you need to make.  Go to Build -> Configuration Manager.  Make sure that Active solution configuration is set to "Debug" and the Active solution platform to "x86_32".  Once that's done, hit F7 to build the Debug x86_32 version of ReactOS.sln (solution).  Expect this step to take a while to complete.
