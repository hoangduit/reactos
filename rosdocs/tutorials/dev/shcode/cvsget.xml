<title>Downloading a CVS client</title>
<para>
To download a CVS client, visit Cyclic Software's CVS client <ulink url="http://www.cvshome.org/downloads.html">download page</ulink>. Although many different types of clients are available, we recommend the command line client and the documentation on this web page is intended for that client.

<title>Configuring your client</title>
<para>
Set the following environment variables (for anonymous login):
<programlisting>
set CVSROOT=:pserver:cvsanon@osexperts.com:/CVS/ReactOS
set HOME=c:\temp 
</programlisting>
You will probably want to put these settings into your autoexec.bat file. These settings assume that you have a directory called c:\temp for temporary files. To log into the CVS server run "cvs login" and, when prompted for a password, enter "cvsanon". This anonymous user has rights to check out source trees and get updates, but cannot add, remove or commit anything into the repository.
</para>
<para>
If you become a contributing developer and acquire a user on our central server, you will change these settings so that the "cvsanon" in the CVSROOT is the username. You will also log in with a password specific to the username instead of "cvsanon".
