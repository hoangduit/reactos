- I rewrite completely the code to get an ip.
- I delete threads beacuse of some deadlocks.
- I add _finally_ support for static ip host.

2002013002:
- After some web surf and some hack there is (i hope so!) a windows port, please BE CAREFULL because i have no way to test it.

2002013001:
- After a lot of work, this is finally working and now is being ported to auto GNU tools.
- I will add the routines to compile it under MSW boxes with winsock.

20020121:
- Well, we have a working version with configuration file and with reduced functionality. If you find bugs, please report them. This version is the last and i'm accepting patches for this version.
20020117:
- Finally there is an alpha release. From now i will start logging what i'm doing.
This alpha release was compiled in a SuSE Linux 7.2 box, i've tested it with my embedded device
and it works. I've tested with one MS Windows 98 workstations and it doesn't work.
