Overview of the ReactOS Project use of code from the WINE Project. 
Providing information on building the dlls, applications and tools provided by WINE.
</para>

<para>
The ReactOS Project will try to do a yearly merge of the Winehq source trees.
This document only relates to building and using WINE dlls for ReactOS. If you are seeking information 
on building Wine for Mingw or Cygwin please go to 
<ulink url="http://www.winehq.com">WineHQ</ulink> and read the Mingw WINE porters guide.

<title>Directions on Porting a WINE dll to ReactOS</title>
<para> 1. Download the most current ReactOS source as per documentation.</para>
<para> 2. Download the most current release or sources of WINE or ReWind. See www.winehq.com for cvs information.</para>
<para> 3. Start MSYS and change directory to your copy of the WINE sources.</para>
<para> 4. run ./configure --disable-win16 in the top level of the WINE source tree.</para>
<para>NOTE: make sure you do not have a make.exe in your path when running MSYS.</para>
<para> 5. Run "make tools" then "cd dlls" the "make".</para>
<para>NOTE: The wine build system will create the import libraries and try to build all of the dlls. Some will fail.</para>
<para> 6. Make any changes you might need to get the dll to compile with MSYS+Mingw and the WINE headers and submit patches to wine-patches@winehq.com.</para>
<para> 7. To test building a dll with the w32api headers rather then a WINE header simply rename the header in wine/include and the build system will use the w32api instead..</para>
<para> 8. Submit any needed patches for the w32api package to the Mingw or Cygwin projects.</para>
<para>WARNING: Using WINE dlls that are not ported to use the w32api are not support by the ReactOS project.</para>
<para> 9. Create a directory in the reactos source tree with the same name as the directory in the WINE source tree and copy the required files. EXAMPLE: reactos/lib/ole32 </para>
<para> 10. Create a makefile based on a existing ported dll such as lzexpand or twain.</para>
<para> 11. Rebuild the dll from cmd.exe using the standard Mingw package and the ReactOS build system.</para>
<para>
Any changes other then minor patches such as include path changes such as those that only come as a result of the ReactOS build system should use the following format
</para>
<para>Example:</para>
<para>#ifdef __REACTOS__</para>
<para>ReactOS code</para>
<para>#endif</para>
<para>DO NOT MAIL REACTOS PATCHES TO WINEHQ. All patches sent to the WINE project must be licensed either LGPL or X11.</para>
