These tasks are required of any IRP handling callbacks provided by a driver
and are outlined in "The Windows NT Device Driver Book" by Art Baker, chapters
9, 10 and 11.

Essential tasks are:

- In the case of device open, close and cleanup requests, manage resources
  needed by each open device instance, including device specific and driver
  specific data allocated in DRIVER_EXTENSION and DEVICE_EXTENSION structures,
  any uncompleted, queued IRPs, and any internally queued requests on behalf
  of either ioctls which cause persistent driver state changes or hardware with
  persistent states that must be tracked.
- Actually interacting with hardware in order to fulfill user requests.
- Manage access to user buffers using MDLs.
- Complete or enqueue IRPs on behalf of user processes or other drivers.
- Manage timers and other system services needed to ensure that the system
  functions correctly.
- Protect the kernel mode environment from harm by validating pointers to user
  memory.
