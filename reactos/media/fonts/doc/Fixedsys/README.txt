Q: I use this font a lot. Am I expected to give you money?
A: No, Fixedsys Excelsior is free. If you feel incredibly grateful, send me an
   email or a letter or something else, maybe rose-flavored Turkish Delight
   (my address is at the bottom). Other flavors are fine too but rose is my
   favorite. And I am generally more concerned with music than fonts, so if you
   have any of that stuff ... Also, if you use IRC, feel free to proselytize to
   your friends. My real intention, if I have one at all, is to make IRC a more
   natural world without removing its distinctive feeling. Sure, maybe you don’t
   speak Farsi, but next time you encounter someone who does, they’ll be typing
   in Arabic, not question marks or boxes. The ultimate form of this dream would
   be to have Fixedsys Excelsior distributed with mIRC or other IRC clients.
