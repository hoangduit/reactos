/* Organization
 *
 * api.c      - Handles the LPC Reply/Request Threads which wait on Sb and Csr APIs.
 *              Also in charge of creating those threads and setting up the ports.
 *              Finally, it provides external APIs for validating the API buffers
 *              and doing server-to-server API calls.
 *
 * init.c     - Handles initialization of CSRSRV, including command-line parsing,
 *              loading the Server DLLs, creating the Session Directories, setting
 *              up the DosDevices Object Directory, and initializing each component.
 *
 * procsup.c  - Handles all internal functions dealing with the CSR Process Object,
 *              including de/allocation, de/referencing, un/locking, prority, and 
 *              lookups. Also handles all external APIs which touch the CSR Process Object.
 *
 * server.c   - Handles all internal functions related to loading and managing Server
 *              DLLs, as well as the routines handling the Shared Static Memory Section.
 *              Holds the API Dispatch/Valid/Name Tables and the public CSR_SERVER API
 *              interface. Also home of the SEH handler.
 *
 * session.c  - Handles all internal functions dealing with the CSR Session Object,
 *              including de/allocation, de/referencing, and un/locking. Holds the SB API
 *              Dispatch/Name Tables and the public CsrSv API Interface for commmunication
 *              with the Session Manager.
 *
 * thredsup.c - Handles all internal functions dealing with the CSR Thread Object,
 *              including de/allocation, de/referencing, un/locking, impersonation, and
 *              lookups. Also handles all external APIs which touch the CSR Thread Object.
 *
 * wait.c     - Handles all internal functions dealing with the CSR Wait Object,
 *              including de/allocation, de/referencing and un/locking. Also implements
 *              the external Wait API for creating, removing and/or notifying waits.

/* What's missing:
 *
 * - SMSS needs to be partly re-written to match some things done here.
 *   Among other things, SmConnectToSm, SmCompleteSession and the other
 *   Sm* Exported APIs have to be properly implemented, as well as the
 *   callback calling and SM LPC APIs. [DONE!]
 *
 * - NTDLL needs to get the Csr* routines properly implemented. [DONE!]
 *
 * - KERNEL32, USER32 need to register with their servers properly.
 *   Additionally, user32 needs to have ClientThreadStartup implemented
 *   properly and do the syscall NtUserInitialize (I think) which also
 *   needs to be implemented in win32k.sys. All this should be less then
 *   100 lines of code. [KERNEL32 50% DONE, USER32 NOT DONE]
 *
 * - The skeleton code for winsrv and basesrv which connects with CSR/CSRSRV
 *   needs to be written. [DONE!]
 *
 * - The kernel's LPC implementation needs to be made compatible. [DONE!]
