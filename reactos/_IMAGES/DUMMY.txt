 /* 
  The sole purpose of this file is to stimulate Visual Studio's build engine. When deciding when to invoke a build
  tool, such as a compiler, Visual Studio always has the intent of generating a target file from a source file. If
  the specified target file is non-existent, or stale, relative to the source file, then the build tool will be
  invoked. Therefore, if we create a dummy source file, such as this file, DUMMY.TXT, and specify a target file that will
  never be actually generated, DUMMY.ZZZ, then each time Visual Studio examines whether to build DUMMY.ZZZ, it
  will always conclude that the answer is "Yes. Try to build DUMMY.ZZZ." In this way, we can force an operation
  to occur, always, for a project. 
  
  In this particular case, we use this technique to build ReactOS target images that can be booted, installed, etc. 
  The creation of a CD, for example, by copying and packing files, is ~always~ done, no matter what might have 
  occured previously.  This same DUMMY.TXT file is used for several Visual Studio projects in the image directory. 
  That is why DUMMY.TXT is an immediate child of the directory _IMAGE.
