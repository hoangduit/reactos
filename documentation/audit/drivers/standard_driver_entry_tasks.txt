These tasks are required of the DriverEntry portion of any driver, and are
described in "The Windows NT Device Driver Book" by Art Baker.

While mostly outlined in chapters 4 and 5, essential tasks include:

- Initializing the device object with function pointers which are called to
  service IRPs on behalf of drivers and devices.
- Creating device objects used to represent driver instances and making them
  available by name in the kernel namespace.
- Possibly acquiring resources for well known, fixed instance devices such as
  legacy ISA.
- Gracefully handling errors and cleaning up resources.
